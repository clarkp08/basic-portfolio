	<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img src="LinkedIn.jpg" alt=phil>

		<p>Hello world, sup? I'm Phil, and this is my portfolio. If you would like to get to know me a little bit, feel free to continue reading (I won't be offended if you don't). I'm originally from Norfolk, Va. No, my family was not in the Navy - we just happen to call this particular military-based city home. I went to East Carolina University on a baseball scholarship; used to be a pretty average outfielder. I moved to Raleigh after graduation and worked in the insurance industry for 3 years whilst living in the City of Oaks, but I made the executive decision to make a career change into web development. So here we are.</p>

		<p>I have loved Raleigh ever since I made the move here. You can typically find me at a local brewery, bar, or really any establishment with televisions and Wi-Fi for me to keep up with my fantasy football team. I also currently am working at a brand new local soccer shop (Premier Soccer), located in the Pleasant Valley shopping center. Stop by and buy stuff!</p>
